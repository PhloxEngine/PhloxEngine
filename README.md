# Phlox Engine

The rewrite of Phlox Engine!

Powered by lua now! (Only because I got the idea at school and I thought that it would be cool lol)

This is kinda just the regular/legacy version of Phlox Engine but lua and no hardcoding...

I recommend NOT using this version yet.

This is all being done by one person so development may be slow.

The required libraries are already included because I don't wanna keep redownloading them whenever I decide to reinstall Windows.
