# Phlox Engine

My attempt at making a game engine.

This rewrite is on hold for now, I may come back to it in the future but the legacy version of Phlox Engine has too much work for me to just scrap it like that to make a RSDK-inspired engine.

## Documentation

## Building

### Windows

Double click PhloxEngineDev.sln to open the project in Visual Studio and build/debug it.

### Arch Linux

```bash
make deps
make discord-rpc
make
```

## Dependencies/Requirements

- No external dependencies (freeglut, etc) are needed because they're included.
- Lettuce - No link yet, still working on it.
