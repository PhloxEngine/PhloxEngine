# Phlox Engine

My attempt at making a game engine.

## Documentation

## Building

### Windows

Double click PhloxEngineDev.sln to open the project in Visual Studio and build/debug it.

## Dependencies/Requirements

- No external dependencies (freeglut, etc) are needed because they're included.
- Lettuce - No link yet, still working on it.

### Arch Linux

```bash
make deps
make discord-rpc
make
```
